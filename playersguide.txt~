Hole is a roguelike turn-based game.

---HOW TO RUN---

Make sure you have python and python-curses installed. If you have apt-get (ubuntu, mint, etc...) run:
sudo apt-get install python

To run the game use:
cd ~/Dropbox/cartelladovestalaroba
python holeNUMERODIVERSIONE.py

you should be greeted by the title card.

---BASICS---

@ - Player
# - Wall
v - Exit

Find the exit to go to the next floor. Go fast or you'll drown in the water.

Red underscore letters are animals (basic enemies.) An a (Ant) is the weakest, a z (Zebra) is the toughest.

Occasionally you can find golden rooms with a dragon (red D) guarding a Chest (which is for now empty.)

---COMMANDS---

Remember to deactivate CAPS LOCK.

ARROW KEYS - Move / Attack
A - Pick up items
D - Drop items
0-9 - Use/equip items
C - Cast spell
P - Commit suicide
I - Check game progress, found emeralds...

Whatever the command you give, existing or not, successful or not, you lose your turn

---ITEMS---

**ASTERISKS**

These items are picked up by walking on them

GOLD - Yellow
Gold is found in yellow nuggets (*). Just walk on it to pick it up.

MANA DROPS - Blue
A mana drop is a blue asterisk. It restores 1 mana point.

EMERALDS - Green
There is one emerald in every level. You can check which emeralds you have collected with the I command. They will grant you a special advantage in the last stage.

**OTHER ITEMS**

You can pick up other items by walking over them and pressing A: they will appear in your inventory. You can use them by pressing the digit relative to their inventory slot (e.g.: you can use the bread you are given by default by pressing 0.) For equippable items, using means equipping. You can drop items with the D key, followed by number - or A-C for equipped items. You can't unequip items and put them back in your inventory, you have to throw them away.

HERBS - Y

Herbs can belong to many species:

*Basil		+40 HP
*Stramonium	-70 HP
*Sage		+2 MANA
*Nettle		+1 ATK with 75% probability
*Dandelion	+1 DFN with 33% probability

and be accompained by adjectives:

*Stinging	-10 HP when picking up AND on usage
*Sacred		+2 MANA
*Spicy		(as for now, no effect)
*Silver		effect is multiplied x2
*Golden		effect is multiplied x5

Many herbs are not identified by default and will appear in your inventory simply as "Herb". You will need a Book of Botany to identify them (but you can still use them blindly.)

BOOKS

Books perform an action and are used once.

Books named after a spell (Fire, Teleport, etc.) perform the corresponding spell (once) with no mana cost (there is still, however, a bonus if using a Magic Wand.) Other books include:

*Book of Botany		identify all herbs in your inventory

FOOD

Food restores health points.

0	Bread		+25 HP
Q	Goulash		+50 HP

---MAGIC---

Magic can be performed as soon as one has acquired Mana points. You can perform spells by pressing the C button and typing a Formula, that is, a sequence of "sacred symbols" (the letters Q, W, E and R) and hitting enter. The length of the Formula can be at most 5 symbols, or 7 if you're holding a Magic Wand. Every symbol uses a Mana point, and the length of the Formula is also limited by your Mana quota. The Formula is scanned for Words from the list below; for every word found, the corresponding spell is cast. You can have more Words, and thus Spells, in a single Formula, thus saving on Mana, but you cannot perform the same Spell more than once in one Formula. Some combination of symbols are cursed words, and will induce a miscast (you will hurt yourself.)

Most spell have an enhanced effect if performed holding a Magic Wand.

This is the basic scheme of how a single Cast works:

FORMULA  -------->   WORDS  ------->  SPELLS
	 contains            induce

An example of a cast:

Player casts formula EWQQQ
* 4 Mana points are used up
* Formula contains words EWQ and QQQ
* A teleport spell is cast
* There is a miscast and the player hurts himself
