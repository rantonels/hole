(questa guida è a caso e temporanea e sarà fatta più meglio più tardi)

Hole is a roguelike(like) turn-based game.


---HOW TO DOWNLOAD---

Hole is frequently updated. One simple way to get the latest stable (kinda) version is to download and extract this archive:
https://github.com/rantonels/hole/archive/master.zip

A more elegant (and quick) method is to use git. On Linux:

$ sudo apt-get install git

and then run:

$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/rantonels/hole.git

everytime you want to update Hole.



---HOW TO RUN---


LINUX / MAC OS (Mac not tested)

First of all, if you want to play in a terminal window, choose a terminal emulator (programs like gnome-terminal, xterm, etc.) that you like and has basic color support. Configure it as you please, selecting a font and size that allows for a screen size of at least 67x26.

Hole will run on Python 2.* and Python 3.3. Only using the latter you will be able to access Unicode mode, because of a linking bug in the curses module for Python 2.

Make sure you have python and python-curses installed (they should already be.) If you have apt-get (ubuntu, mint, etc...) run:

$ sudo apt-get install python

If you want to run in a standalone window (Graphical/Standalone mode) you will also need to install the pygame module.

To run the game use:

$ cd ~/hole
$ ./hole

you should be greeted by the encoding selection menu.

If it complains about not finding python, OR you want to run it with a different python version, run it explicitly as a python script, for example:

$ /opt/python3.3/bin/python3 hole 

(assuming you have python3.3 installed in that directory)



WINDOWS (Finally tested!)

Install Python (2.7 recommended.)

Install the pygame library (avoid 64-bit versions as they don't seem to be able to link correctly to Python. If the setup can't find a Python installation in the registry, switch to the 32-bit version suited to your Python version)

Open a terminal window ("Start" -> "Run"/"Esegui" and type cmd.) Run the command

dir PATHTOGAMEFILES

where the path is where you extracted/copied hole. Then run:

c:\\Python27\python.exe hole

change this line if you have a different version of python.



---ASCII/UNICODE/GRAPHIC---

Ascii Mode: Play in terminal window using ascii graphics with curses (Linux only)
Unicode Mode: Play in terminal window using text graphics with utf8 characters with curses (Linux only, Python 3.3)
Standalone Mode: Play in standalone window with ascii graphics (Windows and Linux)

Hole was originally written using the ASCII charset. This is a very limited but universally supported set of symbols. Since version 1.0.6, a Unicode mode is included, which extend greatly the set of available glyphs and thus provides more interesting graphics. However, it comes with a cost: Hole has to be run with Python3.3, and the terminal emulator and his font must support unicode. If you want to give it a try, you can select UNICODE at the beginning of the game execution. If this menu popping up every damn time annoys you, bypass it by appending the options --ascii, --unicode or --standalone  when running hole on the command line.

When playing in Unicode mode, be wary that symbols are different from those described in this guide.




---CREATING A NEW CHARACTER---

Creating a character might be intimidating if you haven't even started playing. Get confortable with the game concepts by playing a couple of games with the default PC.

Provided you don't choose to use the default character, you will have to build one. The parameters who influence gameplay are:

- Gender
- Attributes

Male players gain in ATK much quickly than Females when leveling up, however Females are immune from the Love Curse from Succubi.

Attributes grant some special permanent ability to the player; you can choose at most 2. They are:

Hawk Eye        extends your Field Of View (see more distant objects)
Dragonborn      half damage when walking on lava
Pious           Mana Drops always yield +2 MANA
Strong Hands    reduce probability of being stripped of items when attacked; increase probability of picking up gnomes



---BASICS---

@ - Player
#,$,% - Walls
v - Exit

Find the exit to go to the next floor. Go fast or you'll drown in the water.





---THE ANNOYING BLUE DOTS---

These things represent your Field Of View (FOV), that is, the places you can currently see. You won't be able to see what's happening (e.g.: monsters, objects) outside your FOV. Now, you might find these dots annoying: you can turn them off with the V key (this will NOT deactivate the FOV dynamics.)






---THE DUNGEON---

A more detailed look at other type of element of the map:

=		        Door		just walk on it to open it
$ (red/white)   Gift Shop	walk on it to buy items from gold. Sold items change with the floor you're in
~ (yellow)	    Lava		will deal you damage (depending on your max. HP) unless you are protected

After a certain number of turns (check the I panel) water will enter the dungeon and start filling it floor by floor. Water (blue ~) will not hurt you, but it will costrain your movement. Water imposes strict bounds on the time you can spend in each floor of the dungeon. You can stop water with a Winter Spell, at least until you descend the stairs.





---COMMANDS---

You can display a panel with all available commands by typing '?', or 'o'.

Remember to deactivate CAPS LOCK.

ARROW KEYS - Move / Attack
A - Pick up items
D - Drop items
U - Use/equip items
C - Cast spell
P - Commit suicide
I - Check game progress, found emeralds, experience points, curse status...
V - Toggle FOV dots





---ENEMIES---

Enemies are red letters, except for gnomes. When an enemy is killed (by any means) you are dealt experience points; the amount depends exclusively on the race of the enemy.

*ANIMALS (a, b ... z)
Red lowercase letters are animals (basic enemies.) An a (Ant) is the weakest, a z (Zebra) is the toughest. Note that n,p,q,s,v,x and z have the ability to freeze you.

*SUCCUBI (S)
Succubi cast a curse (Love) as soon as they attack you, if you are male. If you are in love you cannot attack any Succubus physically (you can still move or use magic though.)

*DRAGONS (D)
Occasionally you can find golden rooms with a dragon (red D.) These are very powerful creatures with a complex behaviour, and can blow fire if they are angered (this deals quite a lot of damage, of course.) Dragons drop Dragon Scales, which can be worn to walk safely on lava.

*FAIRIES (F)
Fairies are rare and shy creatures which often teleport away. Slaying a fairy will produce a Fairy Liver, which is a source of Mana.

*FALSE OBJECTS (C)
False objects take the form of other objects; when you try to pick them up, they explode in a multitude of hostile animals. They can be identified with a Clairvoyance Spell, after which they revert to their true form.

*ICE TROLLS (I)
Powerful monsters that appear in a level right after the casting of a Winter Spell.

*GNOMES (green g)
Gnomes pop up from dirt in caves, try to steal money from you (or an item, if you are broke), then flee back in their tunnels. They can't hurt you, and are immune to attacks or magic. You can try picking them up by walking on them, and they will show up in your inventory. Every gnome has a different name and personality. By "using" a Gnome with the U key, you can search the gnome for loot (your stolen items, for example) {or ask him information.} You can then free the Gnome by dropping him, and he will escape quickly.  *information in {} curly brackets has yet to be implemented.*




---ITEMS---

**ASTERISKS**

These items are picked up by walking on them

GOLD - Yellow
Gold is found in yellow nuggets (*). Just walk on it to pick it up.

MANA DROPS - Blue
A mana drop is a blue asterisk. It restores 1 or 2 mana points (always 2 if you have the "Pious" attribute.)

EMERALDS - Green
There is one emerald in every level. You can check which emeralds you have collected with the I command. They will grant you a special advantage in the last stage.


**OTHER ITEMS**

You can pick up other items by walking over them and pressing A: they will appear in your inventory. You can use them by pressing the digit relative to their inventory slot (e.g.: you can use the bread you are given by default by pressing 0.) For equippable items, using means equipping. You can drop items with the D key, followed by number - or A-C for equipped items. You can't unequip items and put them back in your inventory, you have to throw them away.

HERBS - green Y

Herbs can belong to many species:

*Basil		+40 HP
*Stramonium	-70 HP
*Sage		+2 MANA
*Nettle		+1 ATK with 75% probability
*Dandelion	+1 DFN with 33% probability

and be accompained by adjectives:

*Stinging	-10 HP when picking up AND on usage
*Sacred		+2 MANA
*Spicy		(as for now, no effect)
*Silver		effect is multiplied x2
*Golden		effect is multiplied x5

Many herbs are not identified by default and will appear in your inventory simply as "Herb". You will need a Book of Botany to identify them (but you can still use them blindly.)

BOOKS - ?

Books perform an action and are used once.

Books named after a spell (Fire, Teleport, etc.) perform the corresponding spell (once) with no mana cost (there is still, however, a bonus if using a Magic Wand.) Other books include:

*Book of Botany		identify all herbs in your inventory
*Book of Geography	displays relative position of the exit

MAGIC HANDBOOK - purple =

This allows you to learn a new spell in a given category of your choice.

ARMOUR - ! O : 

Armour can be equipped with u, and it grants advantages as long as they are worn. Equipping more than one item of each typeat a time has no additional effect. When you are physically hit, there is a chance you are stripped of an equipped item.

!	Sword		more damage in physical attacks
O	Shield		less damage in physical attacks
:	Gloves		can pick up Stinging plants without any damage

There is also a Golden version of the Sword and the Shield, which is much more powerful. 


FOOD - 0 Q W

Food restores health points.

0	Bread		+25  HP
Q	Goulash		+50  HP
W	Pasta		+100 HP

a   Carcass     variable

A Carcass is occasionally dropped by dying animals. It can be eaten, but it has a probability of poisoning the player (see Curses). If the feasting is successful, some health is restored; Carcasses of higher animals yield more HP. 


FAIRY LIVER - &

Obtained from a Fairy, gives 50-150 Mana points.


DRAGON SCALES - "

Dropped by a dragon. If equipped, grant protection against lava.


STONE - o

Stone is an item that you might or might not need.


LETTERS, PIECES OF PAPER - l 4

These items can be read by using, and they can give you clues about the story. You might or might not need to keep them in your inventory.


STRAMONIUM SEEDS - .

???

---MAGIC---

Magic can be performed as soon as one has acquired Mana points. You can perform spells by pressing the C button and choosing a spell with the arrow keys. Range will be displayed on screen for spells with limited range. Next to every spell is the Mana cost.

There are three categories of spells: Mind, Body, Light

At first, you will only know the first spell from each category. This spell can be chosen when creating a new character, and is Teleport in the default character. Using a Magic Handbook, you can acquire a new spell in a category of your choice. The complete list of possible spells is displayed in the I Panel.

Most spell have an enhanced effect if performed holding a Magic Wand.




-SPELLS

SPELL		    BASIC EFFECT					    		                    	WITH WAND
--MIND CATEGORY--
Teleport    	teleport the player somewhere else (at random) in the same floor	
Healing	    	heals the player					                        		more healing
Transmigration	teleport to a close given location in a cardinal direction (*)		more range
--BODY CATEGORY--
Shockwave   	pushes enemies away and smashes them on walls				        more push and damage
Fire	    	hits all enemies in an area around the player				        more damage
Winter	    	freezes the water until you descend the stairs (*)
--LIGHT CATEGORY--
Thunder		    hits the closest enemy with a thunder				            	more damage
Clairvoyance	show the inside of rooms close to you					            show the entire floor


* these spells can have serious adverse effects. Transmigrating in a wall or solid object (including stairs) kills you immediatly; if you are instead sent into the same spot as an enemy, you deal him 50 HP of damage, but your own HP are halved (fragging). When you cast the very powerful Winter Spell instead, Ice Trolls make their appearance in the level.




---CURSES---

Curses are prolonged negative effects on the player. They are of various nature, can coexist, and vanish in a set number of turns. The current curses and number of turns left for each curse is displayed in the I panel (press I) or in a simplified form just right of your name. They are usually inflicted on the player when he is hit by particular enemies, or consumes particular items.

CURSE	EFFECT			            	CAUSE
Ice	    no walking or physical attack	hit by n,p,q,s,v,x,z or I		
Love	can't hit Succubi physically	hit by S
Poison  at times can't walk or attack,  eating Carcass
        ends by puking (-20 HP)



---SHOPS---

Shops are red and white $ symbols in the walls. You can use them by walking on them. A menu will pop up, where you can choose the item you want to buy; items are listed with their price in gold nuggets and a number you need to press to buy them.
