Hole is a roguelike turn-based game.




---HOW TO RUN---

LINUX / MAC OS

Make sure you have python and python-curses installed (they should already be.) If you have apt-get (ubuntu, mint, etc...) run:
sudo apt-get install python

To run the game use:

cd ~/Dropbox/pathtogamefiles
./hole.XXX		(XXX is the version number)

you should be greeted by the title card.


WINDOWS

(not tested!)

Install python.

Open a terminal window. Run

DIR PATHTOGAMEFILES

PYTHON HOLE.XXX		(XXX is the version number)






---BASICS---

@ - Player
# - Wall
v - Exit

Find the exit to go to the next floor. Go fast or you'll drown in the water.



---THE DUNGEON---

A more detailed look at other type of element of the map:

=		Door		just walk on it to open it
$		Gift Shop	walk on it to buy items from gold. Sold items change with the floor you're in
~ (yellow)	Lava		will deal you damage (depending on your max. HP) unless you are protected

After a certain number of turns (check the I panel) water will enter the dungeon and start filling it floor by floor. Water (blue ~) will not hurt you, but it will costrain your movement. Water imposes strict bounds on the time you can spend in each floor of the dungeon. You can stop water with a Winter Spell, at least until you descend the stairs.





---COMMANDS---

Remember to deactivate CAPS LOCK.

ARROW KEYS - Move / Attack
A - Pick up items
D - Drop items
U - Use/equip items
C - Cast spell
P - Commit suicide
I - Check game progress, found emeralds, experience points, curse status...

Whatever the command you give, existing or not, successful or not, you lose your turn




---ENEMIES--

*ANIMALS (a, b ... z)
Red underscore letters are animals (basic enemies.) An a (Ant) is the weakest, a z (Zebra) is the toughest.

*SUCCUBI (S)
Succubi cast a curse (Love) as soon as they attack you, if you are male. If you are in love you cannot attack any Succubus physically (you can still move or use magic though.)

*DRAGONS (D)
Occasionally you can find golden rooms with a dragon (red D) guarding a Chest (which is for now empty.), 

*FAIRIES (F)
Fairies are rare and shy creatures which often teleport away. Slaying a fairy will produce a Fairy Liver, which is a source of Mana.

*FALSE OBJECTS (C)
False objects take the form of other objects; when you try to pick them up, they explode in a multitude of hostile animals. They can be identified with a Clairvoyance Spell, after which they revert to their true form.

*ICE TROLLS (I)
Powerful monsters that appear in a level right after the casting of a Winter Spell.





---ITEMS---

**ASTERISKS**

These items are picked up by walking on them

GOLD - Yellow
Gold is found in yellow nuggets (*). Just walk on it to pick it up.

MANA DROPS - Blue
A mana drop is a blue asterisk. It restores 1 mana point.

EMERALDS - Green
There is one emerald in every level. You can check which emeralds you have collected with the I command. They will grant you a special advantage in the last stage.


**OTHER ITEMS**

You can pick up other items by walking over them and pressing A: they will appear in your inventory. You can use them by pressing the digit relative to their inventory slot (e.g.: you can use the bread you are given by default by pressing 0.) For equippable items, using means equipping. You can drop items with the D key, followed by number - or A-C for equipped items. You can't unequip items and put them back in your inventory, you have to throw them away.

HERBS - Y

Herbs can belong to many species:

*Basil		+40 HP
*Stramonium	-70 HP
*Sage		+2 MANA
*Nettle		+1 ATK with 75% probability
*Dandelion	+1 DFN with 33% probability

and be accompained by adjectives:

*Stinging	-10 HP when picking up AND on usage
*Sacred		+2 MANA
*Spicy		(as for now, no effect)
*Silver		effect is multiplied x2
*Golden		effect is multiplied x5

Many herbs are not identified by default and will appear in your inventory simply as "Herb". You will need a Book of Botany to identify them (but you can still use them blindly.)

BOOKS - ?

Books perform an action and are used once.

Books named after a spell (Fire, Teleport, etc.) perform the corresponding spell (once) with no mana cost (there is still, however, a bonus if using a Magic Wand.) Other books include:

*Book of Botany		identify all herbs in your inventory
*Book of Geography	displays relative position of the exit

MAGIC HANDBOOK - =

This allows you to learn a new spell in a given category of your choice.

ARMOUR - ! O : 

Armour can be equipped with u, and it grants advantages as long as they are worn. Equipping more than one item of each typeat a time has no additional effect. When you are physically hit, there is a chance you are stripped of an equipped item.

!	Sword		more damage in physical attacks
O	Shield		less damage in physical attacks

There is also a Golden version of the Sword and the Shield, which is much more powerful.

---MAGIC---

Magic can be performed as soon as one has acquired Mana points. You can perform spells by pressing the C button and choosing a spell with the arrow keys. Range will be displayed on screen for spells with limited range. Next to every spell is the Mana cost.

There are three categories of spells: Mind, Body, Light

At first, you will only know the first spell from each category. This spell can be chosen when creating a new character, and is Teleport in the default character. Using a Magic Handbook, you can acquire a new spell in a category of your choice. The complete list of possible spells is displayed in the I Panel.

Most spell have an enhanced effect if performed holding a Magic Wand.




-SPELLS

SPELL		BASIC EFFECT								WITH WAND
--MIND CATEGORY--
Teleport	teleport the player somewhere else (at random) in the same floor	
Healing		heals the player							more healing
Transmigration	teleport to a close given location in a cardinal direction (*)		more range
--BODY CATEGORY--
Shockwave	pushes enemies away and smashes them on walls				more push and damage
Fire		hits all enemies in an area around the player				more damage
Winter		freezes the water until you descend the stairs (*)
--LIGHT CATEGORY--
Thunder		hits the closest enemy with a thunder					more damage
Clairvoyance	show the inside of rooms close to you					show the entire floor


* these spells can have serious adverse effects. Transmigrating in a wall or solid object (including stairs) kills you immediatly; if you are instead sent into the same spot as an enemy, you deal him 50 HP of damage, but your own HP are halved (fragging). When you cast the very powerful Winter Spell instead, Ice Trolls make their appearance in the level.




---CURSES---

Curses are prolonged negative effects on the player. They are of various nature, can coexist, and vanish in a set number of turns. The current curses and number of turns left for each curse is displayed in the I panel (press I.) They are usually inflicted on the player when he is hit by particular enemies.

CURSE	EFFECT				CAUSE
Ice	no walking or physical attack	hit by n,p,q,s,v,x,z or I		
Love	can't hit Succubi physically	hit by S


---SHOPS---

Shops are red and white $ symbols in the walls. You can use them by walking on them. A menu will pop up, where you can choose the item you want to buy; items are listed with their price in gold nuggets and a number you need to press to buy them.
